## If you voted "Other IDEs", what are they? Or anything else you expect in an IDE for Erlang? (Optional)

* sublimetext
* Acme - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)
* Refactoring & find references would be good, but currently nothing supports it adequately out of the box.
* Good search facilities, easy interaction with other programs
* I am using Atom
* nano
* Vim not with VimErl, but a different set of plugins: scrooloose/syntastic for error checking Valloric/YouCompleteMe code completion
* I voted for IntelliJ and sublime
* I would not want a specific IDE for Erlang rather a strong integration with preexisting editors/IDE, in my case Erlang
* Visual Studio code. Elixir plugin can do some Erlang
* The zero's would be awesome to have, but are not a deal breaker, even though I would be estatic to be shown how they could work in Vim.
* Fast. Easy to use with terminal/tmux, shell utilities
* I use emacs and erlang-mode but EDTS on top of it. Which btw is an actual IDE.
* You need an IDE for Java due to its moronic commingling of language features and directory structure. You don't need an IDE for Erlang.
* Vscode
* Other IDE: neovim Features: - remote shell into running node - git integration
* spacemacs with vim emulation and erlang layer
* Spacemacs
* - display unified documentation from all sources (edoc, specs, comments)
* I'm OK with Vim/Emacs, but for beginners more "modern" IDEs look appropriate. VScode, Atom, IntelliJ, and others look nice.
* N/A
* I love Sublime.
* visual studio code
* n/a
* none
* no
* command line su editing occasionali
sublimetext
* autocomplete and code format are really important thing IMO
* Jetbrains is just fine, except for the part when you can not do complex debug like process message tracking and stuffs like so.
* I use geany for Linux . Hot code loading of code integrated in an IDE would be cool .
* .
* live template
* VS Code
* Visual Studio Code
* Plain sublime
* The IDE should be cross-platform.
* I don't IDE, I prefer code editor + shell. Features that make editing code easier are good for an editor, other tools belong in the shell.
* supervision tree visualisation would be amazing!
* Syntax highlighting and error detection are most important. Completion is next and everything else is just gravy.
* I use vscode.
* Nothing else.
* To not be an IDE.
* visual code
* I'm writing my own - https://github.com/gasparch/vim-ide-elixir . Check it out and promote :)

* Visual studio code
* EDTS
* EDTS, an emacs based Erlang editor developed in Klarna.
* vscode
* Nope
* I am not an emacs person. But I would love to see a rabar3/hex aware IDE with better features than IntelliJ.
* Sometimes use nano on the remote side
* hi
* Intellisense for functions, keywords,etc.
* gedit, kate
* It seems I cannot leave this field blank.
* I hope your project works....
* Emacs style incremental search and powerful text editing commands.
* Monitoring running node tools are important too.
